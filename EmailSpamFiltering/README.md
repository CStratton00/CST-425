# Email Spam Filtering Project
In this project, we will analyze a large csv. file of spam and non-spam emails
with Naive Bayes Classification. We will then create a Naive Bayes Machine Learning model
and predict spam emails based on a testing set.

Project Deliverables:
1. Data setup and exploration 
2. Preparing training and testing sets 
3. Build the Bayesian model 
4. Improve the model 
5. Output interpretation 
6. Estimate errors 
7. Make predictions using the test set 
8. Model verification 
9. Final spam identification results
