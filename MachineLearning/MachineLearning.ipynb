    "# Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this assignment is to synthesize the complex aspects of machine learning. Specifically, this project will create an image model that will be able to predict the type of food an image of a food item is, and then pass in an image of a dog to see what type of food the dog is. This is a fun way to implement machine learning in a unique way to showcase the skills learned in this course."

    "## Machine Learning Problem\n",
    "Image recognition is extremely useful and can be used in many ways. We have the idea of figuring out which foods a dog would be. This may not be a breakthrough project by itself but at its core can be very useful. Creating the model proved to take a very long time, but with the implementation of CUDA cores to speed up the image model using tensorflow and cv2, we looked to improve the code we found that creates the model. Machine learning models should utilize technology to the fullest and companies that are not implementing CUDA in their code could be losing lots of money and time on their models.\n",

    "### About the dataset:\n",
    "Our dataset is from kaggle (link at the bottom) with 101 different foods and about 300 pictures per food item. Using this super in depth color image dataset, we are able to build an accurate model for these foods that will allow the best fit for any dog we enter into the model. Our data does not need to be normalized or standardized before it is used in the modeling process. There is no need to handle outliers for the pictures because all the foods in each folder are indeed the correct food, but possibly at an angle or presented differently but this would help our model instead of hurting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Code:\n",
    "The first step is downloading the full dataset from kaggle and running it locally on our device. We decided to preform it locally instead of on GitHub since the file sizes would be too big. Then the os paths of the labels and food items are taken and put in a pandas dataframe."

    "## Further Implementation\n",
    "This project could be further implemented by discovering what food image has the closest resemblance to the dog image given from the model. The implementation of this would look like the following below but took to long to run to test if it works. Our next step was to implement CUDA using @jit but there was a library dependency error with numba and numpy so it was unsuccessful. First, an image likeness recognition model would be used to compare the similarity of the image of the dog and all the images in the food group the dog got classified as. Next, the image with the highest likeness would be displayed to the user with the image of the dog for the user to do their own visual comparison. Further development needs to be done to be able to find a different method to compare the images.\n",

    "This project was a fun way to implement machine learning in a unique way to showcase the skills learned in this course. The code is very simple and the results are very interesting. Even though the model was trained to be able to predict what type of food is in an image, it is versatile enough to be able to predict what type of food a dog is. The model got up to 90% accuracy on the food set, so we can only assume its high accuracy in predicting what type of food a dog is."
