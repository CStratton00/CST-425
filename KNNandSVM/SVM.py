# SVM Classifier

## Load the appropriate software packages.
## Pre-process the data.
## Subset the data.
## Split the data into training and testing sets
## Build the classification model.
## Run the model (make predictions).
## Display classification results (quantitative and visual)
## Provide the confusion matrix for each classifier.
## For each classifier, compute the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
## Explain the use of the ROC curve and the meaning of the area under the ROC curve.
## Compare the results obtained with each one of the classifiers, referring to the confusion matrix and associated metrics. Are the results similar? If not, how statistically different are they? If different, what is the reason? If similar, how would you decide to use one method or another?
