```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

### Get data about cars
```{r data}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

### Dist by GPU
![Euclidean Distance](r-gpu0x.png)
```{r dist}
x <- mtcars["Honda Civic",]
y <- mtcars["Camaro Z28",]
x
y
print("Distance between Honda Civic and Camaro Z28")
dist(rbind(x,y))

z <- mtcars["Pontiac Firebird",]
print("Distance between Firebird and Camaro")
dist(rbind(y,z))
```

### For a data sample of size M, the distance matrix is an M × M symmetric matrix with M × (M - 1)∕2 distinct elements. Hence for a data sample of size 4,500, its distance matrix has about ten million distinct elements. Nevertheless, depending on your application, a sample of size 4,500 may still to be too small to be useful.

```{r distMatrix}
dist(as.matrix(mtcars))
```

### The following measures the time spent on finding the distance matrix for a collection of 4,500 random vectors in a 120 dimension space. On a laptop computer with Intel i7 x6 CPU, it takes about *5.4 seconds* to finish.

```{r speedTest}
test.data <- function(dim, num, seed=17) { 
     set.seed(seed) 
     matrix(rnorm(dim * num), nrow=num) 
} 

m <- test.data(120, 45000) 
system.time(dist(m))

```

### Calculations using **rpuDist** from the **rpud** package, running on NVIDIA GeForce RTX2080

```{r GPUcalc}

#library(rpud)
system.time(rpuDist(m))
```

### **mtcars** on GPU
```{r mtcarsGPU}
rpuDist(rbind(x,y))
rpuDist(as.matrix(mtcars))
```
