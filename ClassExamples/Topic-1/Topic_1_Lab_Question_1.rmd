## White Wine Quality Dataset
I chose the wine quality dataset due to large amount of data and the easy-to-understand nature of the dataset. There are just under 5000 rows of data that will be beneficial when creating linear models. See below the displayed data and a summary() function which calculates Min, Max, 1st/3rd Quartile, Median, Mean.
